// Sever notes:
// EC2 instance with node and pm2 installed - elastic ip assigned to ec2 for stability of ip
  // connect to EC2 with ssh `ssh -i aws-test-key-turntimer.pem ubuntu@3.83.94.212`
    - pem is on local desktop
  // git pull to get server changes and stop/start node instance with pm2
  // nginx installed on top of express server with socket.io installed

used zero ssl and some hacky verification by returning txt content from a express route
        - didnt need to upload anything to ec2 instance or change nginx static hosting
        - generated csr with openssl
        - used that in zerossl
        - 
scp -i aws-test-key-turntimer.pem ../../Downloads/54.175.61.41/certificate.crt ubuntu@54.175.61.41:/etc/ssl

ssh -i aws-test-key-turntimer.pem ubuntu@54.175.61.41

sudo service nginx restart

sudo systemctl stop nginx

do everything again using zero ssl but generate new csr
can copy with 
 - sudo mv 54_175_61_41.key /etc/nginx/ssl/ once scp into server

- get env variables up and remove the extra stuff from server index in the urls
